# Creating a CI/CD Pipeline for your Cloud Application

## Introduction

In this section, we describe steps how to configure and run predefined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that automatically test, build, and deploy your code changes to speed up your development and delivery cycles.

**Persona:** Cloud Administrator (SAP BTP) / Cloud Application Developer

**Abbreviation:** SAP Business Technology Platform = SAP BTP


## Step-by-Step


### Create Github Repository

This step describes how to create a Github repository in which you can store the source code of your project. You need to have a user in the public GitHub to execute the steps below.

1. Open your github home page.
2. Click on *New* in the **Repository** tab to create a new repository.

   ![Create Github Repo](./images/newRepository.png)
   
3. Enter the name of the repository. For example, **extendUI**. Do not check the checkbox **Intialize this repository with a README**.
4. Click on create repository.

    ![Create Github Repo](./images/createGitRepo.png)

5. Copy the github url of the newly created Git repository.

   ![Copy GitHub URL](./images/copyGitHubURL.png)
   

   
### Generating OAuth Token

1. As the public Git hub announced deprecation of Basic Authentication, we have described steps to login with the Access tokens to the Git.
2. Refer to the public GitHub link and create a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
3. You can use these Access tokens when you want to use Git commands instead of giving Git password.

### Add Git repository to HTML5 project

1. Login to your SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) account. 
2. Let us open the service **Business Application Studio** by following the steps described in [Open SAP Business Application Studio](../develop/README.md#open-sap-business-application-studio).
3. You would be prompted with a login screen of the default/custom Identity Provider depending on how you have configured.
4. Login to the Application using your default/custom Identity Provider credentials.
5. If your workspace is stopped, click **Start** to start your dev space and click the name of your dev space to open your workspace.
6. Open a new terminal and navigate to project root folder.

   ![Open Terminal](./images/openTerminal.png) 
   
7. Enter your email address and User name to be used by Git. You can use the email address which you have used to register the Git account.
   ```
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
8. Now we are initializing a Git repository which can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. To use  other Git commands, you need an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you**ll run in a new project. Let us run the following commands:

	```
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Push project content to github"
    ```
   ![Git Commit](./images/commitProject.png)
    
9. Now take the copied GitHub Repository URL which you created and copied in step 5 of **Creating GitHub Repository** and add this URL pointing as the remote repository.

   ```
   git remote add origin <copied Git repository url.git>
   ```
    
10. Let us push the commit with project contents to the default branch of your GitHub Repository. Please check in your GitHub repository if your default branch is master or main.  
    
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```
    
11. When prompted, enter your Git Username and Password (or Token).

### Test automatic triggering of CI/CD job

You**ve configured a webhook between GitHub and the SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery service . Now, whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository, a webhook push event is sent to the service and triggers a build of the connected job.

1. To test automatic triggering of the build job, let us change a file and push the changes to the Git repository.
2. Switch to the **Business Application Studio** and open the workspace in which the project is created. 
3. Change the index.html file by editing the title. 

   ```
   <h1> Updated Business Partner </h1>
   ```
   ![update Project](./images/updateProject.png) 
   
4. Switch to the **Source Control: Git** tab and add the **index.html** file from the unstaged changes to the staged changes by clicking the **+**, Enter a commit message for example: "Test Commit". Click the tick symbol as shown in the screenshot to commit the changes.

   ![commit Changes](./images/commitChanges.png)
   
5. Let us push the commit by switching to the **Terminal** window like before. Enter the following command and push to your default branch (master or main), then enter your GitHub user name and GitHub access token. 

   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   ![push Commit](./images/pushCommit.png)
   
6. This Git push to the repository triggers the SAP Continous Integration and Delivery job. Switch to the browser window **Continous Integration & Delivery** to check the automatically triggered job.
