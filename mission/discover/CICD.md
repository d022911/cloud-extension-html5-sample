# Learn About DevOps and SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery

**DevOps** is not a methodology nor a framework. It is a culture, a movement, and a philosophy built on the four principles of culture, automation, measurement, and sharing. The willingness to break down silos, such as project planning, development, and operations, is key for the collaboration.

**Continuous integration (CI)** describes a software development process, in which various team members integrate their contributions frequently into a single main line. 

The **continuous delivery (CD) concept** expands on the one of continuous integration. It adds the aspect that any change that has successfully passed the tests is immediately ready to be deployed to production, both from a technical and a qualitative point of view.
